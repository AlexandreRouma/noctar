Systemd service file.

This directory contains langford.service, a systemd unit file. On systems running
systemd, this should be placed in the systemd directory. On Arch Linux machines,
this directory is found here;

/usr/lib/systemd/system/

After being copied to this directory, you'll be able to automatically launch the 
service at boot, by enabling it using the systemctl interface;

systemctl enable langford.service

If this is your first time running it, you may also want to start it with;

systemctl start langford.service
